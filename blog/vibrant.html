<br><br>
<p>
So the <strong>question</strong> arises, Why I am writing this Blog ? What Are the Reasons For Writing ‚úçÔ∏è ?<br>
<br>
<strong>Ans - </strong>Damm, I just Want to Share My Experience and Feelings with Help of This Blog...

<br>
<br><ul>
<mark><strong>1. THE TIME SO FAR </strong></mark><br>
<br>
While It was Year  2015 Maybe..We all Of Us (friends) were in Childhood  Phase...
<br>
It was a Time when I was in Primary School...
<br>
Now When i look Past only the memories revolves around... 
<br>
Because many of my friends are still in Contact with me  But Some Of them are Not in my Contact..<br>Now, It has been 7 years  approax ..
</ul>

<br>
<ul>
<mark><strong>2. What I missed ! </strong></mark><br>
<br>
Now this is the point I am most concerned of.<br> I missed The Rounds of Talk with them(friends)...<br> Missed the Past experience..And all The events that A friend Miss In the Absence  Of His friends...<br>And last , Also Missed the love and Caring Of Teachers..
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<mark><strong>3. The Experience  and Feelings ! </strong></mark><br>
<br>
Yeah that Period was Not A good For me for sure...<br> I missed Many of My old Friends ..<br> But Now I am Adapted to this situation...
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<mark><strong>4. How I get In Contact With Them Later ? </strong></mark><br>
<br>
At 1st when i Left the School then I have the Contact Number of all Of them In a Page...<br> But Unfortunately, that page was lost... then I lost the Hope Too..<br> Later in Class 7th,By chance, One of My old Friend Named Sanjana Contacted Me in The NS Dav Public School.. Actually We met Each Other In the School Bus at the school üè´ departure time...<br> Then I got Hope Again...<br> Then By all means I Contacted Other Friends by All of My Links and Contacts...<br> And Now the Situation is that I have Contact Of Most of My friends...
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<mark><strong>5. Present Situation And End Note</strong></mark><br>
<br>
Obviously, Now i talk/chat with Most of them...<br> And Now the Situation Is far better than Before..<br> <strong> I wish WE Should Gather Again </strong> and <strong> Arrange a Meet </strong> Of All the Old Friends. And Capture The Moments of That Meet By the Camera..(Having the Photoshoot)..
